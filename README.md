# Piggy-ProjG

Piggy-ProjG is a web application which makes it possible for professor to publish several projects online, from which the students can choose whatever they are interested in. 

To elaborate on this, the professor should describe those projects and decide the maximal number of students expected for each project and each group. And students are able to choose more than one project they are interested in, and arranged them by how much they are interested in (or willing to do) this project. Finally, the system should present the grouping result to both professors and students.

The application should deal with all the things mentioned above in the form of web pages, which means users should have access to this application via any modern browser.
